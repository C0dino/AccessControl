# AccessControl

##What is this?
This Program can be used to perform what is sometimes referred to as "Long Decode".  

##Long Decode - Explanation
Long Decode can be used for sites which may have ordered multiple HID Prox cards from many different sources and now has too many facility codes (Limitation of 8 card formats per mercury intelligent controller aka "IC").  This can also be an issue with multi-tenant spaces where you have many different companies wanting to use their companies specific prox card to gain entry to the multi-tenant shared areas/resources.

## Purpose
This program provides a small conveniance by converting the Facility code (FAC) and the Card code into the final number you can expect when reading it on one of the Access Control software platforms (Such as Lenel, Prowatch, Genetec etc)
